## Description

The goal of this game is to fill in the blank spaces in the words on the game board. Draw a line between the letters in the picker to form a word and see if you get a match!

## Who’s it for?

This game is a brain tease/puzzle game that uses letters and words as “puzzle pieces”, and it’s suitable for a variety of audiences; adults and older children alike.

## Game mechanics/controls

The player interacts with the circular “picker”, which tracks a continuous swipe/drag between letters. If the chosen letters form a valid word that’s represented on the game board, the player increases her score and the blank tiles on the board get filled in. Once every word is filled in you win!

The data, i.e. the words, that the game is based on is a set of 5 keywords relating to the company/client. These words should be representative of the company and its products and/or values. It’s recommended that the keywords provided by the company should be relatively short, around 5 characters, although the game works with slightly longer words as well.

Based on the provided keywords, a new set of words will be generated for each keyword. These sets will consist of anagrams of the keyword; meaning, words that only contain the letters of the keyword. On game start, a random keyword will be chosen and it as well as its related words will be the basis for the game board. If the player enters the keyword, she gets bonus points.

## Settings & Customization

The main aspect of the game is the words provided by the client, and this data needs to follow a given format that is made clear in the game script.

A section in the script is provided where the client can customize several different text values, for example the name of the game and the instructions.

Game settings can also be changed; should attempts counting be enabled, how many points should regular words and keywords be worth, etc.

Some graphic element settings are available in the script as well, however, the visuals of the game are mostly customizable through the CSS/styling file. Here the client can change font, colors, and optional background images for the start page and the “picker”, i.e. the game controller. These options are made available through variables in the root element, at the top of the file.

## Platforms

The game is available on both mobile and desktop.
